pressing challenges of our time. As the global population continues to rise and the demand for energy increases, the reliance on fossil fuels poses significant environmental and economic threats. In this context, renewable energy sources have emerged as a viable alternative, offering a path toward sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions.\n\n1. Understanding Renewable Energy\n\nRenewable energy refers to energy derived from resources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sources provide a cleaner and more sustainable energy supply. Solar power, for instance, harnesses sunlight using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity, while wind energy converts the kinetic energy of wind into power through turbines.\n\n2. Environmental Benefits\n\nThe transition to renewable energy plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), adopting renewable energy could significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for global warming and climate instability. By reducing our reliance on coal, oil, and natural gas, we can decrease air pollution, leading to improved public health outcomes and a reduction in healthcare costs associated with pollution-related illnesses.\n\n3. Economic Opportunities\n\nInvesting in renewable energy not only benefits the environment but also creates substantial economic opportunities. The renewable energy sector has been a significant source of job creation, often outpacing traditional fossil fuel industries. In 2020, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reported that the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people worldwide, with jobs expected to increase as more countries commit to sustainable energy goals.\n\n4. Energy Security and Independence\n\nRenewable energy also enhances energy security and independence. By diversifying energy sources, countries can reduce their reliance on imported fuels, which can be subject to price volatility and geopolitical tensions. For instance, countries that invest in solar and wind energy can harness their local resources, leading to greater energy autonomy. This not only stabilizes energy prices but also enhances national security by reducing vulnerability to external energy supply disruptions.\n\n5. Challenges and Considerations\n\nDespite the numerous advantages, the transition to renewable energy is not without challenges. Issues such as the intermittent nature of renewable sources—like solar and wind—require the development of energy storage technologies and grid management solutions. Furthermore, the initial investment costs for renewable energy infrastructure can be high, although these costs have been decreasing rapidly due to technological advancements and economies of scale.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, renewable energy represents a critical component of a sustainable future. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating jobs, enhancing energy security, and providing clean power, renewable energy sources can significantly contribute to sustainable development. Policymakers, businesses, and individuals must work collaboratively to overcome existing challenges and accelerate the transition toward a greener, more sustainable energy landscape. As we move forward, embracing renewable energy will be essential in addressing the global challenges of climate change, economic inequality, and energy insecurity.\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.412131Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.412441Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.424039Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.412408Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.423186Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### It generates a summary by creating new sentences that capture the meaning of the original text, rather than extracting exact phrases or sentences.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### We can paraphrase the output text for better understanding ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ndevice = \"cpu\"\n\nparaphrase_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"humarin/chatgpt_paraphraser_on_T5_base\")\n\nparaphrase_model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"humarin/chatgpt_paraphraser_on_T5_base\").to(device)\n\ndef paraphrase(\n    question,\n    num_beams=5,\n    num_beam_groups=5,\n    num_return_sequences=5,\n    repetition_penalty=10.0,\n    diversity_penalty=3.0,\n    no_repeat_ngram_size=2,\n    temperature=0.7,\n    max_length=128\n):\n    input_ids = paraphrase_tokenizer(\n        f'paraphrase: {question}',\n        return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=\"longest\",\n        max_length=max_length,\n        truncation=True,\n    ).input_ids.to(device)\n    \n    outputs = paraphrase_model.generate(\n        input_ids, temperature=temperature, repetition_penalty=repetition_penalty,\n        num_return_sequences=num_return_sequences, no_repeat_ngram_size=no_repeat_ngram_size,\n        num_beams=num_beams, num_beam_groups=num_beam_groups,\n        max_length=max_length, diversity_penalty=diversity_penalty\n    )\n\n    res = paraphrase_tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)\n    \n    \n\n    return res","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.427281Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.428054Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-23T13:16:16.551656Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-23T13:15:26.428017Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-23T13:16:16.550681Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer_config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/2.32k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"85d3790480374c8c9f9c76429ad3e5ed"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"spiece.model:   0%|          | 0.00/792k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"75be45dde9d64cfdb8b3c986982afc6c"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer.json:   0%|          | 0.00/2.42M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"399c9305fe6143958642d8ab0e1aae64"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"special_tokens_map.json:   0%|          | 0.00/2.20k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"353d5802174d47968d73f87f90943585"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:1617: FutureWarning: `clean_up_tokenization_spaces` was not set.

Renewable energy sources offer a more sustainable and cleaner energy source than fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC suggests that using renewable energy could significantly reduce global greenhouse gases, leading to job losses. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sources offer a more sustainable supply of energy. The IPCC has suggested that using renewable energies could significantly decrease global greenhousegas emissions—which cause climate instability and global warming. In 2020, the IEC announced that the renewable electricity sector employed over 11 million people worldwide, with jobs expected to increase as more countries pursue sustainable energy goals. In comparison to fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sources offer a more sustainable and cleaner supply of energy. The IPCC has suggested that using renewable energies could significantly decrease global greenhousegas emissions from the future, as well as from increasing jobs in the renewable power sector. In 2020, the IEC reported that over 11 million people worldwide worked in this sector, with job creation expected to increase as more countries follow through on their commitment to sustainable energy goals. The IPCC has concluded that the use of renewable energy sources could have a significant impact on global warming by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which are more sustainable than fossil fuels.
